## ðŸ’¬ Career Assistant Chatbot Project
This project is an intelligent career assistant chatbot that leverages structured data from my CV (in PDF format), a text-based professional summary, and public repositories from my GitHub profile to assist users in career-related discussions.

The chatbot is powered by function-calling tools and can dynamically interact with users using real-time data and responses. It supports three main tools:

### ðŸ§  Language Model (LLM)
The chatbot is built on `gemini-2.0-flash`, a lightweight and high-speed version of Google's Gemini large language model family. This version is optimized for fast inference and low latency, making it ideal for real-time chatbot interactions. It provides:
* Fast response generation
* Strong understanding of structured prompts
* Efficient tool-calling and reasoning
* Lower resource usage compared to heavier models
 
### ðŸ”§ Implemented Tool
 
* ðŸ“Œ `record_unknown_question`
If the chatbot is unable to answer a user's question, whether it's related to career or not, it triggers this tool to log the unknown question for further review and improvement.

* ðŸ“¨ `record_user_details`
When a user engages in meaningful discussion, the assistant encourages them to provide their email address for further contact. This information is securely logged using this tool.

* ðŸ“‚ `list_github_repos`
If a user asks about the projects I've worked on, this tool accesses my public GitHub repositories and returns a structured list containing:
    * Project Name
    * URL
    * Description<br>Each project is then described in bullet point format for clarity.

### ðŸ”” Smart Notifications
For real-time updates, both the `record_user_details` and `record_unknown_question` tools are integrated with Google Chrome push notifications, ensuring I receive alerts whenever:
    * A new user email is captured
    * A new unanswered question is recorded
