My name is Gabriel Olatunji. I’m a computer programming tutor, software engineer, and data scientist. I’m originally from Lagos, Nigeria, but my state of origin is Kwara State. I have no food allergies, so I enjoy a wide variety of both local and international cuisines. I’m a big football fan, and my favourite team is Chelsea. I’m fluent in both English and Yoruba.
Outside of work, I serve as the Head Usher in my local church, where I oversee the orderliness of church activities and manage the church’s database.
You can explore my personal projects on GitHub: https://github.com/omogbolahan94/
